<p>A desert is an arid ecosystem that receives fewer than 10 inches of precipitation annually. Desert ecosystems
support little vegetation and animal life, as the conditions are extremely harsh. Deserts are formed through
the weathering processes of rocks, prompted by large variations between day and night temperatures that cause
the rocks to break into pieces. Deserts are common in every part of the world including Europe, although the
continent is perceived to lack deserts since it is mainly associated with snow-capped peaks, green meadows,
sweeping hills, luxurious beaches, and bustling cities. Europe has a combination of both true deserts and semi-deserts
which are mainly found in Spain, Italy, Serbia, and Romania. The unique land formations and locations of these
deserts and semi-deserts make them ideal tourist attractions in Europe.</p>

<h2>Accona Desert, Italy.</h2>

<p>The Accona Desert is a semi-desert located in the Crete Senesi, near Tuscany Italy. As a semi-desert, precipitation
 in the Accona reaches highs of 24 inches per annum, which supports human and plant life. Cultivation is supported
through large irrigation projects. The semi-arid region has unique land formations, including the medieval Abbey
of Monte Oliveto Maggiore. The semi-desert features rare land formations of white and light color dome-shaped
dunes that form stunning land attractions in Tuscany.</p>

<h3>Oltenia Sahara Desert, Romani.</h3>
<p>
The Oltenian Sahara is the largest desert in Europe and covers an area of more than 200,000 acres. It is located
in the Oltenia region, which includes the area between the city of Calafat, Romania and the town of Dabuleni, Romania.
The desert is not a natural land formation, as it resulted from significant deforestation in the 1960s which created
vast sandy areas characterized by little precipitation. The name "Sahara" was incorporated by the press due
to the expansive coverage of the desert. It is the only place in Europe that has an official sand museum. The
government has introduced a tree-planting project to prevent further desertification and rehabilitate the desert
so that it can support life.</p>

<h3>Tabernas Desert, Spain.</h3>
<p>
The Deliblato Sands is the largest sand desert in Europe, covering a total of 300 square kilometers. The desert
is located in the southeast part of the Pannonia Plains in Vojvodina, Serbia. The desert is a remnant of a prehistoric
desert that was formed following the withdrawal of the Pannonian Sea, and it has a unique elliptical shape that
was created during the Ice age period. The Deliblato Sands plays a key role in the biodiversity of Serbia,
as it is home to 900 diverse plant species, some of which are endemic and therefore not found in any other
parts of the world.</p>

<h3>The Highlands of Iceland</h3>
<p>
The Highlands of Iceland is a semi-desert located in Iceland. It is a unique formation, as it does not rely
on sand and extreme temperatures to qualify as a desert. The volcanic soil synonymous with the plateau absorbs
precipitation so quickly that it does not support any plant life, making it mostly uninhabitable.</p>

<p>As evident above, there are four(4) important desert and they are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Accona Desert, Italy.</li>
<li>Oltenia Sahara Desert, Romani.</li>
<li>Tabernas Desert, Spain.</li>
<li>The Highlands of Iceland</li>
</ul>
