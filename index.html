<aside>
<blockquote>A desert is a barren area of landscape where little precipitation occurs and, consequently, living conditions
are hostile for plant and animal life. The lack of vegetation exposes the unprotected surface of the ground
to the processes of denudation. About one-third of the land surface of the world is arid or semi-arid. <br/>
 According to Wikipedia</blockquote>

<p>This includes much of the polar regions, where little precipitation occurs, and which are sometimes called 
polar deserts or "cold deserts". Not only in <a href="Africa.html">Africa</a> and <a href="Asia.html">Asia</a> but also in <a href="Europe.html">Europe</a> can
Deserts be classified by the amount of precipitation that falls, by 
the temperature that prevails, by the causes of desertification or by their geographical location.
Deserts are formed by weathering processes as large variations in temperature between day and night put 
strains on the rocks, which consequently break in pieces. Although rain seldom occurs in deserts, there 
are occasional downpours that can result in flash floods. Rain falling on hot rocks can cause them to 
shatter, and the resulting fragments and rubble strewn over the desert floor are further eroded by the wind.</p>

This picks up particles of sand and dust and wafts them aloft in sand or dust storms. Wind-blown sand 
grains striking any solid object in their path can abrade the surface. Rocks are smoothed down, and the 
wind sorts sand into uniform deposits. The grains end up as level sheets of sand or are piled high in 
billowing sand dunes. Other deserts are flat, stony plains where all the fine material has been blown away 
and the surface consists of a mosaic of smooth stones. These areas are known as desert pavements, and little
further erosion takes place. Other desert features include rock outcrops, exposed bedrock and clays once 
deposited by flowing water. Temporary lakes may form and salt pans may be left when waters evaporate. There
may be underground sources of water, in the form of springs and seepages from aquifers. Where these are 
found, oases can occur.</p>

<p>
Plants and animals living in the desert need special adaptations to survive in the harsh environment. Plants
tend to be tough and wiry with small or no leaves, water-resistant cuticles, and often spines to deter herbivory.
Some annual plants germinate, bloom and die in the course of a few weeks after rainfall, while other long-lived plants survive for years and have deep root systems able to tap underground moisture. Animals need to keep cool and find enough food and water to survive. Many are nocturnal, and stay in the shade or underground during the heat of the day. They tend to be efficient at conserving water, extracting most of their needs from their food and concentrating their urine. Some animals remain in a state of dormancy for long periods, ready to become active again during the rare rainfall. They then reproduce rapidly while conditions are favorable before returning to dormancy.
People have struggled to live in deserts and the surrounding semi-arid lands for millennia. Nomads have moved
their flocks and herds to wherever grazing is available, and oases have provided opportunities for a more settled
way of life.</p>

<p>
The cultivation of semi-arid regions encourages erosion of soil and is one of the causes of
increased desertification. Desert farming is possible with the aid of irrigation, and the Imperial Valley
in California provides an example of how previously barren land can be made productive by the import of
water from an outside source. Many trade routes have been forged across deserts, especially across the
Sahara Desert, and traditionally were used by caravans of camels carrying salt, gold, ivory and other goods.
Large numbers of slaves were also taken northwards across the Sahara[citation needed]. Some mineral extraction
also takes place in deserts, and the uninterrupted sunlight gives potential for the capture of large quantities
of solar energy.</p>
