<p>
Several significant deserts stretch across Asia and the Middle East. Here we highlight of 
the map and brief description of the major ones, including the Arabian, Gobi, Karakum, Kyzylkum,
Takla Makan and Thar.</p>

<h2>Arabian Desert</h2>
<p>
The Arabian Desert is a vast desert wilderness stretching from Yemen to the
Persian Gulf and from Oman to Jordan and Iraq. It is the largest desert in Asia at 900,000
square miles and occupies most of the Arabian Peninsula. This desert is located in the Middle
East. </p>

<h3>Gobi Desert</h3>
<p>
The Gobi Desert is the 2nd largest desert in Asia, covering 500,000 square miles.
Extending from northern China into Mongolia, the Gobi Desert receives an average of 7 inches
of rainfall each year because the Himalaya mountains block rain clouds from reaching the
region.</p>
    
</section>
<section>
<h3>Kara Kum Desert</h3> 
<p>
The Kara Kum covers 135,000 square miles, nearly 70 percent of Turkmenistan's
land. Because of the desert's location along the Caspian Sea, the weather in Karakum is
milder than many Asian deserts, which typically experience frigid winters and scorching
summers.</p>

<section>   
<h3>Kyzyl Kum Desert</h3> 
<p>
Crossing over Kazakhstan into Uzbekistan, this 115,000 square mile desert
features a wide variety of flora and fauna. Though the area only receives 4 to 8 inches
of rain per year, the rain occurs during the region's cooler period so the water does not
dissipate quickly and supports large migratory game.</p>

<section>
<h3>Takla Makan Desert</h3>
<p>
This China's largest desert extends over 123,550 square miles. Composed primarily
of shifting crescent sand dunes, the Takla Makan is one of the largest sandy deserts in the
world. Despite the inhospitable and unpredictable nature of the desert sands, the Chinese
government erected a road across the desert in the mid-1990s.</p>
  
</section>
<section>
<h3>Thar Desert</h3>
<p>
This desert covers 77,000 square miles in India and Pakistan, the Thar Desert is Asia's
only subtropical desert. Primarily occupying the Indian state of Rajasthan, the Thar receives
up to 20 inches of rain per year, primarily during the monsoon period from July to September,
and most crops are grown during this rainy season.</p>
